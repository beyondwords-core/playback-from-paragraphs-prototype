        The Crown Prince exchanged vows on Thursday in a lavish ceremony.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-7">
        Princess Kate wore a stunning pink Jenny Packham gown adorned with sparkles.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-8">
        Her brunette locks were held back with a gorgeous tiara while long shimmering earrings framed her smiling face.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-9">
        The Princess of Wales held a matching pink clutch as she was pictured shaking hands with other elite guests at the luxurious wedding reception which hosted 1,700 people.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-10">
        The royal couple had snuck in shortly before the wedding ceremony today to watch Jordan's heir tie the knot with Saudi architect Rajwa Alseif, 29.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-11">
        They joined the star-studded crowd of spectators to celebrate the lavish nuptials in the Jordanian capital of Amman.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-12">
        Members of other royal clans from Belgium, Spain, Denmark, the Netherlands and Japan also dusted off their hats for the wedding.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-13">
        Prince William donned a dark suit and blue tie for the occasion, while Kate sported a long pink Elie Saab dress.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-14">
        The pair were seen briefly greeting Jordan's King Abdullah II and Queen Rania as they arrived at the Zahran Palace.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-15">
        It is the same venue where the Crown Prince's father as well as his grandfather the late King Hussein, tied the knot.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-16">
        Kate and Wills' attendance was kept under wraps and they reportedly landed early on Thursday to make the ceremony.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-17">
        Princess Beatrice, 34, also made the guest list for the exclusive wedding.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-18">
        The Crown Prince and his bride Rajwa exchanged vows in front of 140 high-powered guests in the immaculate gardens of the palace.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-19">
        Huge crowds gathered across the country as they waited to watch the wedding via live stream on enormous screens.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-20">
        Supporters waved flags and sported white-and-red checkered scarves in honour of Jordan's ruling family, the Hashemites.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-21">
        Thursday was declared a national holiday as celebrations were hosted in all 12 of Jordan's governorates.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-22">
        Kate and William both have a well-known fondness for Jordan, with the Princess of Wales even spending a chunk of her childhood there.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-23">
        They have even taken their three children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis on holiday to the country.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-24">
        The Jordanian and British royal families are known to share a special relationship.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-25">
        Both William, 40, and Crown Prince Hussein are graduates of Britain's Royal Military Academy of Sandhurst.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-26">
        The two spent time together when the crown prince hosted William during a 2018 trip to Jordan.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-27">
        But it goes back even further - as the British monarchy helped install the Hashemites in then-Transjordan a century ago and remained involved in Jordanian affairs in subsequent decades.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-28">
        Hussein's grandfather, the late King Hussein, and his father, King Abdullah II, also attended Sandhurst.
