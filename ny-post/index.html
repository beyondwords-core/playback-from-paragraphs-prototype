        It could be the plot of a dark comedy if it weren’t a science tragedy.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-1">
        A janitor working in a laboratory who was annoyed by an incessant beep reportedly flipped a switch that killed the noise — but also shut off a storage freezer, destroying decades of scientific work, according to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute lab in Troy.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-2">
        The cleaner’s alleged carelessness cost the lab at least $1 million in damages, a lawsuit the university filed against its third-party cleaning service charges.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-3">
        “People’s behavior and negligence caused all this,” Michael Ginsberg, RPI’s attorney, told the Times Union in Albany. “Unfortunately, they wiped out 25 years of research.”
      </p>

      <img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000013193128.jpg?quality=75&strip=all" />

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-4">
        The super-cold freezer the custodial worker allegedly shut down held cell cultures, samples, and other elements stored at -112 degrees Fahrenheit, the Times Union said.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-5">
        But when the worker from Daigle Cleaning Services shut off the circuit breaker on September 17, 2020, to silence a beeping alarm, the temperature leapt to -25.6 degrees, which damaged or destroyed the material, the lawsuit claimed.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-6">
        The freezer alarm had been triggered by a mechanical malfunction that stopped the unit from maintaining a constant temperature, as it was supposed to.
      </p>

      <img src="https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/06/NYPICHPDPICT000013193315.jpg?quality=75&strip=all" />

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-7">
        Repairs had been scheduled for September 21, 2020, the Times Union reported.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-8">
        A sign on the lab freezer door explained the source of the alarm, and also bore instructions on how to silence it, the Times Union reported.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-9">
        “No cleaning required in this area,” the sign said. “You can press the alarm/test mute button for 5-10 seconds if you would like to mute the sound.”
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-10">
        The cleaner thought they were flipping the breaker on when they actually turned it off, according to a report filed by the RPI public safety staff afterward.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-11">
        “A majority of specimens were compromised, destroyed and rendered unsalvageable demolishing more than 20 years of research,” the lawsuit said.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-12">
        The newspaper said Derek Foster, president of Albany-based Daigle Cleaning Services, could not be reached for comment.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-13">
        Ginsberg told the news outlet it would cost an estimated $1 million to replicate the work, which reportedly focused on photosynthesis and might have furthered solar panel development.
      </p>

      <p data-beyondwords-marker="marker-14">
        The cleaning company had a $1.4 million contract to clean the RPI facilities during the 2020 fall semester.
